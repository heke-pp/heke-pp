- 👋 Hi, I’m @heke-pp
- 👀 I’m actually an HW guy (ASIC, FPGA, discrete, MCU).
- 🌱 Writing mostly C, VHDL, occasionally Python, Assembly, VB, etc.
- 💞️ Aspiring to do my microscopic contribution to the open source movement.
- 📫 Do not hesitate to contact (Note: I do not have a distant unknown relative, who wants to donate all his/her money to me.)
